1. Test should run in a Docker container.

I didn't success to run the tests in a docker container. I tried to set up the Docker container on my personal pc(Windows), but didn't wanted to run.
I researched and tried several solution, but non of them could run the Desktop version of Docker.
I have an error "This installation package is not supported by this processor type. Contact your product vendor" when Im opening my Desktop Docker and I can't get pass this error.

I know is not the solution, but I worked with Docker container. And these are the steps that i remember:
- create an account on https://hub.docker.com/ an download 'Docker Desktop Installer'.
- install the Desktop version of Docker (if needed log in)
- run 'docker -v' on the terminal to check the Docker version
- run 'docker pull hello-world' to verify that docker in running
- go to https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images/tree/master/included and copy the last version of cypress/included
- cd to project
- run 'docker pull cypress/included:12.3.0'
- docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up -d
